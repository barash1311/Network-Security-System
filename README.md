# Website Authenticity Detection

This project is designed to detect whether a website is fake or genuine using a machine learning model. It leverages MLOps practices and AWS services for deployment and management.

## Overview

The Website Authenticity Detection project uses machine learning to analyze website features and determine their authenticity. It is deployed using AWS services and follows MLOps best practices for continuous integration and deployment.

## Features

- **Fake and Genuine Detection**: The model analyzes various features of a website to classify it as fake or genuine.
- **Automated Deployment**: Utilizes CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS to ensure scalability and reliability.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implements logging and monitoring to track performance and detect issues.

## Architecture

- **ML Model**: A machine learning model trained to classify websites based on extracted features such as URL patterns, content analysis, and metadata.
- **AWS S3**: Used for storing datasets, model artifacts, and logs.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the application and runs the model inference, providing computational resources.
- **AWS ECS/ECR**: Manages containerized applications and Docker images, facilitating easy deployment and scaling.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
